Comskip is a free mpeg commercial detector. It is a windows console application
that reads a mpeg file and analyses the content based on a large amount of 
configurable parameters.  After analysis it generates a file in various possible
formats containing the location of the commercials inside the mpeg file.
The formats include input files for Personal Video applications like SageTV
or GBPVR, interactive video editors (VideoRedo, Cuttermaran,Mpeg2Schnitt...)
command line video cutters (mpgtx, cuttermaran, mencoder) and video players 
(zoomplayer, mplayer, ...).  Comskip can read MPEG and h.264 video and MPEG2,
AC3 and AAC audio from PS, TS and dvr-ms files upto HD resolution 
(max 2000x1200) at 25fps (PAL) and 29.97fps (NTSC).
